            "text": "This extension is a text to Siddhi event source mapper. Transports that publish text messages can utilize this extension to convert the incoming text message to Siddhi events. Users can either use the  onEventHandler which is a pre-defined text format where event conversion happens without any additional configurations, or specify a regex to map a text message using custom configurations.  Syntax  @source(..., @map(type= text , regex.groupid= STRING , fail.on.missing.attribute= BOOL , event.grouping.enabled= BOOL , delimiter= STRING , new.line.character= STRING )  QUERY PARAMETERS  \n     \n         Name \n         Description \n         Default Value \n         Possible Data Types \n         Optional \n         Dynamic \n     \n     \n         regex.groupid \n         This parameter specifies a regular expression group. The  groupid  can be any capital letter (e.g., regex.A,regex.B .. etc). You can specify any number of regular expression groups. In the attribute annotation, you need to map all attributes to the regular expression group with the matching group index. If you need to to enable custom mapping, it is required to specifythe matching group for each and every attribute. \n         \n         STRING \n         No \n         No \n     \n     \n         fail.on.missing.attribute \n         This parameter specifies how unknown attributes should be handled. If it is set to true  a message is dropped if its execution fails, or if one or more attributes do not have values. If this parameter is set to  false , null values are assigned to attributes with missing values, and messages with such attributes are not dropped. \n         true \n         BOOL \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         event.grouping.enabled \n         This parameter specifies whether event grouping is enabled or not. To receive a group of events together and generate multiple events, this parameter must be set to  true . \n         false \n         BOOL \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         delimiter \n         This parameter specifies how events must be separated when multiple events are received. This must be whole line and not a single character. \n         ~~~~~~~~~~ \n         STRING \n         Yes \n         No \n     \n     \n         new.line.character \n         This attribute indicates the new line character of the event that is expected to be received. This is used mostly when communication between 2 types of operating systems is expected. For example, Linux uses ' ' as the end of line character whereas windows uses ' '. \n          \n         STRING \n         Yes \n         No \n       Examples  EXAMPLE 1  @source(type='inMemory', topic='stock', @map(type='text'))\ndefine stream FooStream (symbol string, price float, volume long);  This query performs a default text input mapping. The expected input is as follows:symbol:\"WSO2\", price:55.6, volume:100ORsymbol:'WSO2', price:55.6, volume:100If group events is enabled then input should be as follows,symbol:'WSO2', price:55.6, volume:100 ~~~~~~~~~~ symbol:'WSO2', price:55.6, volume:100  EXAMPLE 2  @source(type='inMemory', topic='stock', @map(type='text', fail.on.unknown.attribute = 'true', regex.A='(\\w+)\\s([-0-9]+)',regex.B='volume\\s([-0-9]+)', @attributes(symbol = 'A[1]',price = 'A[2]',volume = 'B' )  This query performs a custom text mapping. The expected output is as follows:wos2 550 volume 100",
