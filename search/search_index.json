Versions 1.x and lower with group id org.wso2.extension.siddhi.* from here . Latest API Docs Latest API Docs is 2.0.4 . Features text ( Sink Mapper ) This extension is a Event to Text output mapper. Transports that publish text messages can utilize this extension to convert the Siddhi events to text messages. Users can use a pre-defined text format where event conversion is carried out without any additional configurations, or use custom placeholder(using {{ and }} ) to map custom text messages. Again, you can also enable mustache based custom mapping. In mustache based custom mapping you can use custom placeholder (using {{ and }} or {{{ and }}} ) to map custom text. In mustache based custom mapping, all variables are HTML escaped by default. For example: is replaced with amp; \" is replaced with quot; = is replaced with #61; If you want to return unescaped HTML, use the triple mustache {{{ instead of double {{ . text ( Source Mapper ) This extension is a text to Siddhi event input mapper. Transports that accept text messages can utilize this extension to convert the incoming text message to Siddhi event. Users can either use a pre-defined text format where event conversion happens without any additional configurations, or specify a regex to map a text message using custom configurations. Dependencies There are no other dependencies needed for this extension. Installation For installing this extension on various siddhi execution environments refer Siddhi documentation section on adding extensions . Support and Contribution We encourage users to ask questions and get support via StackOverflow , make sure to add the siddhi tag to the issue for better response.

The groupid can be any capital letter (e.g., regex.A,regex.B .. etc). You can specify any number of regular expression groups. In the attribute annotation, you need to map all attributes to the regular expression group with the matching group index. If you need to to enable custom mapping, it is required to specifythe matching group for each and every attribute.

If it is set to true a message is dropped if its execution fails, or if one or more attributes do not have values. If this parameter is set to false , null values are assigned to attributes with missing values, and messages with such attributes are not dropped. true BOOL Yes No event.grouping.enabled This parameter specifies whether event grouping is enabled or not.

The groupid can be any capital letter (e.g., regex.A,regex.B .. etc). You can specify any number of regular expression groups. In the attribute annotation, you need to map all attributes to the regular expression group with the matching group index. If you need to to enable custom mapping, it is required to specifythe matching group for each and every attribute. STRING No No fail.on.missing.attribute This parameter specifies how unknown attributes should be handled. If it is set to true a message is dropped if its execution fails, or if one or more attributes do not have values. If this parameter is set to false , null values are assigned to attributes with missing values, and messages with such attributes are not dropped. true BOOL Yes No event.grouping.enabled This parameter specifies whether event grouping is enabled or not. To receive a group of events together and generate multiple events, this parameter must be set to true . false BOOL Yes No delimiter This parameter specifies how events must be separated when multiple events are received. This must be whole line and not a single character. ~~~~~~~~~~ STRING Yes No new.line.character This attribute indicates the new line character of the event that is expected to be received. This is used mostly when communication between 2 types of operating systems is expected. For example, Linux uses \\n as the end of line character whereas windows uses \\r\\n . \\n STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @source(type='inMemory', topic='stock', @map(type='text')) define stream FooStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); This query performs a default text input mapping.
